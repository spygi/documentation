- Declarations: your components, directives and pipes
- Imports: other NgModules that this particular module needs to function properly
- Providers: the service providers, they are available app-wide. You can scope them when using feature modules and lazy loading
- Bootstrap: creates the component(s) listed in the bootstrap array and inserts each one into the browser DOM.
- Exports

## @Component
Every component must be declared in exactly one NgModule: when you need it elsewhere, import the module that has the declarable you need in it.

## Routing
A module. Import it in app.module. 
Have an array of routes to Components.
routerLink to the route.
Make a component routable by injecting ActivatedRoute and Location (if you need a back button)

The method is called forRoot() because you configure the router at the application's root level
The RouterOutlet is one of the router directives that became available to the AppComponent because AppModule imports AppRoutingModule which exported RouterModule.
