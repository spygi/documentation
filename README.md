I found I learn (and remember) better when I don't just read but write and organize what I read as well. 

The idea of this repo is to do just that: hold general, tech documentation for me, not associated to a specific project. For project documentation check out the individual repos' wikis. These notes are not supposed to be shared with the public (eg. like a blog post) but are more to help me learn and remember in the future.
